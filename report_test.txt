QUERY: 'caption:Hamburger'
INDICI: immagini
----------------------------------------
RISULTATI:
  - Outline of this experiment. On day 1, the body weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) were calculated by dividing the skeletal muscle mass (kg) by the square of the height (m 2 ), average grip strength of both hands, and BDHQ (Brief-Type Self-Administered Diet History Questionnaire) responses. The metrics for the first test meal (pizza, 304 kcal), including the number of chews, chewing tempo, and number of bites, were measured. The meal duration was measured via video analysis. Four weeks later, the metrics were measured again when the participants ate a hamburger lunch meal. The meal duration, number of chews, number of chewing tempos, and number of bites were measured when the participants were instructed to eat vegetables first. Four weeks later, a third set of measurements was taken as the participants again ate the hamburger lunch meal. The meal duration, number of chews, number of chewing tempos, and number of bites were measured when the participants were instructed to eat the vegetables last. A slice of pizza (Microwave Mix Pizza, Maruha Nichiro, Tokyo, Japan; energy, 304 kcal; protein, 11.0 g; fat, 11.5 g; carbohydrate, 39.2 g. Hamburger steak bento (hamburger steak (60 g), rice (100 g), and broccoli (100 g)) (energy, 301 kcal; protein, 12.2 g; fat, 6.9 g; carbohydrate, 42.9 g).
