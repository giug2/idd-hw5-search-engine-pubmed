The metrics for the first test meal (pizza, 304 kcal), including the number of chews, chewing tempo, and number of bites, were measured. The meal duration was measured via video analysis. Four weeks later, the metrics were measured again when the participants ate a hamburger lunch meal. The meal duration, number of chews, number of chewing tempos, and number of bites were measured when the participants were instructed to eat vegetables first. Four weeks later, a third set of measurements was taken as the participants again ate the hamburger lunch meal. The meal duration, number of chews, number of chewing tempos, and number of bites were measured when the participants were instructed to eat the vegetables last.

    - University of North Carolina health lifestyle inventory questionnaire for eating patterns and physical activity. University of North Carolina (UNC) Health adapted the validated “Food Frequency Questionnaire” to Lifestyle Inventory Questionnaire to assess dietary habits, beverage and snack consumption, and physical activity in clinical settings. The tool prompts patients to self-report their typical eating behaviors for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, including the frequency of eating out, food choices, and patterns at restaurants. Additional sections capture the intake of common beverages (e.g., water, soda, coffee, alcohol, energy drinks) and snacks (e.g., fruits, chips, pastries), as well as details about regular physical activity, including type, duration, and frequency. This instrument is designed for practical use in identifying and quantifying Ultra-processed food (UPF) and Sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) so clinicians can offer personalized counseling.

A vegetarian would consume 50% NPBFs (assigning average meat consumption to PB meat-alternatives) which are supplemented with a certain number of ABFs (like eggs and cheese), while a flexitarian would consume 10% NPBFs (assigning average meat consumption to PB meat-alternatives) in addition to ABFs.

    - Conceptual framework linking dietary patterns, dietary metabolites, and DNA methylation to chronic disease outcomes . This diagram illustrates the hypothesized relationships between subjective measures of diet (dietary patterns) and more objective biomarkers of intake and exposure (dietary metabolites and DNA methylation) in relation to health consequences such as coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), aging, and other chronic conditions. We hypothesize that dietary patterns may show weaker and less robust associations with outcomes due to recall bias and imprecision. In contrast, dietary metabolites, as more objective indicators of recent intake, may be more strongly and immediately associated with health outcomes. Finally, DNA methylation captures the long-term biological responses to exposure, potentially reflecting the cumulative effects of diet and other environmental factors. Arrows indicate hypothesized directions of influence, with DNA methylation and dietary metabolites acting as intermediates or biomarkers linking diet to disease. (Score: 5,2702)
