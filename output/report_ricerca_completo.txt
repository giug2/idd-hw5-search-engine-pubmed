The metrics for the first test meal (pizza, 304 kcal), including the number of chews, chewing tempo, and number of bites, were measured. The meal duration was measured via video analysis. Four weeks later, the metrics were measured again when the participants ate a hamburger lunch meal. The meal duration, number of chews, number of chewing tempos, and number of bites were measured when the participants were instructed to eat vegetables first. Four weeks later, a third set of measurements was taken as the participants again ate the hamburger lunch meal. The meal duration, number of chews, number of chewing tempos, and number of bites were measured when the participants were instructed to eat the vegetables last.

    - Diet quality, added sugars and proportion of energy from the four Nova categories across the three groups. Diet quality measured by (A) HEI‐2015 across the three groups is not significantly different ( p = 0.522, p = 0.175, respectively). (B) Percent of energy from added sugars by total sugars (g) across the three groups is not significantly different ( p = 0.395). (C) Percent of energy for each Nova category 1–4 across three groups (AB, CD, HC). No significant differences were observed within any of the four Nova categories across the three groups ( p > 0.05). Participants consumed most of their energy from Nova 4: Ultraprocessed foods (UPFs). (Score: 4,7812)
